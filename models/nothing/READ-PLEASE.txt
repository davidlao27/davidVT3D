Hey, thank you for investigating the repository files out of curiosity.
I'm davidlao. Well, davidlao, davidlao27, davidlao_yt, davidlao_ and many others i dont remember at times.

Anyways, I just wanted to tell you, if you're going to use this model, please do not claim it as yours.
I know there isn't any license, but hard work is hard work.

Of course you can use it to test personal stuff, but please do not use it for public intentions.

NOTICE:
If you do use it no matter what I mentioned before, at least credit my GitHub or davidlao#6968
That'd be better appreciated than just stealing the model.

Thank you and enjoy the software itself!

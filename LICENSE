the davidlao C0:SRS license, unlike the C0:NRS license, has some rights reserved.

now, what does this gibberish mean?
this means you may only have permission over the source of the project if you meet one of these requirements:

2. you are not an individual BUT are part of a *non-profit* organization, and give proper credit to the product and share the license with your users.

apart from those requirements, there's a few dont's which *void* product support:
1. users related to: zoophilia, pedophilia and/or incest ON ANY WAY.
2. users related with bigotry when it comes to: racism, xenophobia, LGBTQIA+ (homophobia, transphobia, etc.), ableism, sexism, antisemitism and/or religious intolerance
3. users related to any Web3/Blockchain technology (with the exception of mining cryptocurrency)

    <h2>The menu</h2>
    <hr><br>
    The menu is a left-side panel that can be opened with a hidden button.<br>
    That hidden button can be reached by <b>clicking the top left side of the window screen.</b><br><br> If you didnt understand that, it's the top left part of this white-background documentation page.
    <br><br>
    If you're still dumb and don't know where it is, just tap <b>the Z key on your keyboard</b> to open up instead.
    <br><br><br>
    Alright, now you should be in it, it looks like this:<br>
    <i>(you can click it to open it on another tab)</i>
    <br><br>
    <img src="menu_image.png" onclick="window.open('menu_image.png')" width="100vw">
    <br><br>But... what is this? What does everything mean?<br><br>
    <b>Volume</b> means the required volume for your character to start using the talking animation. Below, you have your current microphone volume saying "right now:" and a number.<br>
    <br> Try speaking into your microphone. It gets higher, right? Talk for a few seconds and calculate by mind what you think the value should be. (by the way, the default is 11 because it works fine with that on mine)<br><br>Okay okay okay, but now, what about the URLs? What are they?<br><br>
    <b>The first URL</b> is the FBX file of your character with an idle animation, without talking.<br>
    <br><b>The second URL</b> is the FBX file of your character with a talking animation.
    <br><br>(in conclusion, you can read the Character section for more info)
    <br><br>
    <div class="genbtn" onclick="window.open('https://davidlao27.github.io/davidVT3D/docs/character','_self')">Using a character</div>
    <br><br><br>Now, what are the so called "Other" settings? 0F0? BG Image?<br>
    <b>The first textbox (defaulted to 0F0)</b> is the hex code (#RGB or #RRGGBB) of the background color that david3VT will use. Think of it as a chroma key color also known as a greenscreen.
    <br><br><b>The second textbox (BG Image URL)</b> is where you put the URL of a background image if you want to directly replace like chroma key does without any imperfections. If you want a 3D model you should just be able to add it to your character separate from the animations making it look like maybe you are in a house.<br>
    <br>If you simply just want something like a regular VTuber to put it over a screen capture in OBS, change the first textbox's hex color to the chroma key color you wish and filter it on OBS (for transparency).<br>
    <br><b>The plain shading checkbox</b> marks if you want flat shading or not (see Lighting section).<br>
    <br><b>The textbox next to it</b> is the color you want the "scene" light to be in something like 0xRRGGBB hexadecimal.
    <br><br>
    Finally, use "Close" to close the menu and/or "Apply" to apply the parameters.

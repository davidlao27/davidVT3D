    <hr><br>
    The core of davidVT. Characters. But... how do you make them? How do you use them? How do you animate them? Many questions to answer...
    <br><br>
    First off, you should read the Menu section:
    <br><br>
    <div class="genbtn" onclick="window.open('https://davidlao27.github.io/davidVT3D/docs/menu','_self')">The menu</div>
    <br><br><br>
    Alright, now you should know that there are two URL textboxes.<br>
    I won't be talking about lighting in this section, go to the Lighting section on the documentation to find out about it.
    <br><br><i>But now... okay, where do you begin?</i><br>First off, you should get the recommended software, and if you're not used to it, get a grasp of it.<br><br>
    Here, I will be talking about <b>Blender</b> because it is where I make characters that work with david3VT, plus its easy to find documentation about it rapidly without major issues.
    <br><br>
    Keep in mind this won't be a tutorial on how to make a blender model, though. This is a basic guidance to it.<br><br>
    Okay, so you will now begin following my setup for the sake of comfort. Most of these steps will take quite some time:
    <ul>
        <li>Make a folder anywhere where your character files will be (blend files, textures and FBX exports)</li><br>
        <li>Open Blender and make a "General" type 3D project. Save it to the folder you just made and call it "neutral.blend" (This will be the idle animation without talking)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make a character model/mesh to be rigged. Its forward must be X and its top Z, because if not, it will appear flipped/rotated. Preferably use a T-Pose style, but you can put it in any way you wish.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make an armature and begin making bones for the mesh you made before (torso, limbs, head, fingers, whatever you wish to animate)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Parent the armature and mesh together. Best choice sometimes is to use Automatic Weights (select the mesh, then hold shift and select the armature, then press CTRL+P to "Parent") and select Automatic Weights, or if you're experienced, select whatever you wish.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Try entering Pose Mode. Does every bone move correctly? Then next step. If not, fix it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Get into the animator and press the circle which records pose movements. In conclusion, animate it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>After your neutral animation rig is done animated, go to file, Export as FBX.</li>
        <br>
        <li>IMPORTANT STEP, DONT MISS ANYTHING: On the top of the popup, you should see Path Mode. Change it to "Copy". Now go down and find "Forward" and, next to it, "Up". Change it to "X Forward" and "Z Up" accordingly. Now, navigate to the folder of your character files and save the FBX. Call it "neutral.fbx" for example. Click "Export FBX".</li>
        <br>
        <li>Congrats, now you should have the FBX file and a folder called "neutral.fbm" next to it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Now repeat the same procedure right from the step where you animate making another FBX file called "neutral_talk"</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you wish to have custom extra animations, there's two more slots, call one "happy" and the other "happy_talking", ignore the names though.</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you do not wish to have any extra animations, copy the FBX files and folders (neutral, neutral_talk) and rename them to happy and happy_talking accordingly. If you do not do that, david3VT will have issues because "files will be missing". Think of it as a requirement.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Now, you should have neutral, neutral_talk, happy and happy_talking folders and files, or similar, or whatever you named it. Publish them to a site like a GitHub repository so the files are together on a server as URL.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Lastly, on the david3VT menu, replace the URLs with your ones and press the Apply button of your choice.</li>
    </ul>
